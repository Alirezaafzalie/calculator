Calculator Application with Tkinter
This project is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
Responsive GUI: Designed with an intuitive layout using the Tkinter library.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Displays "Error" for invalid inputs.
Clear Functionality: Allows users to clear the input field.
Real-time Calculation: Processes and evaluates user input dynamically using Python's eval() function.
How It Works
User Input: Users can enter numbers and operators by clicking the on-screen buttons.
Calculation: The = button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
Clear: The C button clears the input field.
Code Structure
button_click(value): Appends numbers or operators to the input field.
clear(): Clears the content of the input field.
calculate(): Evaluates the entered mathematical expression and displays the result.
Layout
Numeric buttons (0-9) and decimal (.) are arranged for easy access.
Operators (+, -, *, /) are placed to the right for convenience.
A clear button (C) and a result button (=) are included for better usability.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python)
Running the Application
Copy the code into a .py file, e.g., calculator.py.
Run the file using the command:
python calculator.py
Preview
The GUI consists of a clean layout, displaying a text entry field for the input and buttons for operations.

Note
This calculator uses the eval() function to process user input, which can pose security risks if arbitrary code execution is possible. It is suitable for educational purposes but not recommended for production use without sanitizing input.

Feel free to fork, modify, and enhance the code to suit your needs!
